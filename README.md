# Chatbot
This is a simple web app called Simple ChatBot App. The project was developed using the PHP programming language. This chatbot application simulates a conversation with the end user. End users can ask anything using this app and the chatbot will automatically respond to the question/question accordingly. The program has an admin panel where the web user can answer questions that the user can ask/ask.
The admin panel has many functions related to chatbot data. Admin users can control some details at the beginning of the conversation, such as the welcome message, invisible question, and avatar. As for the chatbot's response, administrators will store the data in the system and flag any issues with that response. The system also stores unanswered questions in the database. From this, the administrator can check if the problem is with the website.
If so, the admin user can create an answer to this question.
